# Backend Development Summary - 2025-09-20

Today's development session focused on fixing backend bugs related to user authentication and email verification.

## Email Verification

* **SendGrid Integration:** The backend was configured to use SendGrid for sending email verification links. The `sendgrid-django` library was installed, and the `settings.py` file was updated to use the SendGrid email backend. The `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL` was also set to a valid email address to ensure that emails are sent correctly.
* **Email Confirmation View:** The `ImproperlyConfigured` error that occurred during email confirmation was resolved by creating a custom email confirmation view. This view handles the email confirmation and redirects the user to a confirmation page on the frontend.
* **Console Email Backend:** To debug the `ConnectionRefusedError`, the `EMAIL_BACKEND` was temporarily set to `django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend`. This allowed us to see the content of the verification email in the console and confirm that the email was being generated correctly.
* **Debugging Email Confirmation:** Added debug logging in `CustomConfirmEmailView` to track success and failure of email confirmations. This allows developers to monitor when a key is confirmed successfully or when an invalid/expired key is used, which helps quickly identify issues during testing.
* **Frontend Redirect Validation:** Tested both success (`email-confirmed`) and failure (`email-confirm-failed`) redirects to ensure the flow works properly with the frontend.

## User Authentication

* **Login and Signup:** The non-Google login and signup functionality was debugged and fixed. The backend was expecting `username` and `password1` fields, while the frontend was sending `email` and `password`. The frontend was updated to send the correct data to the backend.
* **JWT Authentication:** Confirmed that token-based authentication using SimpleJWT is working correctly for login sessions.
